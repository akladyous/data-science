### Probability Rules

1. **Addition Rule:**
    - **Formula for Mutually Exclusive Events:**
    $[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) ]$
    - **Formula for A and B are Not Mutually Exclusive Events:**
    $[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) ]$
    - **Summary:** The Addition Rule calculates the probability of the union of events and depends on whether the events are mutually exclusive.
2. **Multiplication Rule:**
    - **Formula for Independent Events A and B:**
    $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
    - **Summary:** The Multiplication Rule calculates the probability of the intersection of independent events by multiplying their individual probabilities.
3. **Conditional Probability:**
    - **Formula:**
    $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
        
        By rearranging this equation, you get:
        
    - $P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) \cdot P(B)$
    - **Summary:** Conditional Probability assesses the likelihood of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.
4. **Complement Rule:**
    - **Formula:**
    $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$
    - **Summary:** The Complement Rule calculates the probability of the complement of event A (not A).
5. **Law of Total Probability:**
    - **Formula for a Partition {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ}:**
    $P(A) = P(A|B₁)P(B₁) + P(A|B₂)P(B₂) + \ldots + P(A|Bₖ)P(Bₖ)$
    - **Summary:** The Law of Total Probability calculates the probability of event A using the probabilities of its possible ways of occurring.
6. **Bayes' Theorem:**
    - **Formula:**
        
        $[P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}]$
        
    
    **Summary:** Bayes' Theorem updates the probability of event B given new evidence provided by event A.
