    "# Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is a concept in probability theory that deals with the likelihood of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as \\(P(A|B)\\) and is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "By rearranging this equation, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) \\cdot P(B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- \\(P(A|B)\\) is the conditional probability of event A given event B.\n",
    "- \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) is the probability of the intersection of events A and B.\n",
    "- \\(P(B)\\) is the probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of conditional probability assumes a dependence between the two events. If events A and B are independent, then \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\), indicating that the occurrence of event B does not provide additional information about the occurrence of event A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory and has applications in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and data analysis.\n"
