The OLS method aims to find the best-fitting line through a set of data points by minimizing the sum
of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. Here's how it works:

1. **Model Representation**: In linear regression, we assume a linear relationship between the
   independent variable(s) (features) and the dependent variable (target). Mathematically, this
   relationship is represented as:
   $[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n +
   \varepsilon ]$ where:

   - $( y )$ is the dependent variable (target).
   - $( \beta_0 )$ is the y-intercept.
   - $( \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n )$ are the coefficients associated with each independent
     variable.
   - $( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n )$ are the independent variables (features).
   - $( \varepsilon )$ represents the error term.

2. **Cost Function**: The OLS method minimizes the cost function, which quantifies the difference
   between the actual target values and the predicted values. The cost function for OLS is the sum
   of squared residuals (errors):
   $[ J(\beta*0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_n) = \sum*{i=1}^{m}(y*i -
   (\beta_0 + \beta_1x*{i1} + \beta*2x*{i2} + ... + \beta*nx*{in}))^2 ]$
   where:

   - $( m )$ is the number of data points.
   - $( y_i )$ is the actual target value for the $( i^{th} )$ data point.
   - $( x\_{ij} )$ is the $( j^{th} )$ feature value for the $( i^{th} )$ data point.

3. **Minimization**: The goal is to find the values of the coefficients
   ($( \beta_0, \beta_1, ...,
   \beta_n )$) that minimize the cost function $( J )$. This is
   typically done using optimization techniques such as gradient descent or matrix calculus.

4. **Fitting the Line**: Once the optimal coefficients are found, they are used to define the
   best-fitting line through the data points. This line represents the linear regression model that
   predicts the target variable based on the input features.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The fitted model can be evaluated using various metrics such as R-squared,
   Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess its accuracy and
   performance on unseen data.

In summary, the OLS method in linear regression aims to find the line that minimizes the sum of
squared differences between the observed and predicted values, providing a simple yet powerful tool
for predictive modeling in data science.
