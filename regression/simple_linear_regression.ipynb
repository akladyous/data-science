    "### Hypothesis Testing in Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of linear regression, hypothesis testing involves evaluating the statistical significance of the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. Specifically, it aims to determine whether the independent variable(s) have a significant effect on the dependent variable, and whether the coefficients estimated by the regression model are significantly different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$\n",
    "The null hypothesis states that there is no significant relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[ H_0: \\beta_1 = 0 ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $( \\beta_1 )$ is the coefficient (slope) associated with the independent variable of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Hypothesis $(H_1)$\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis and asserts that there is a significant relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. For a simple linear regression with one independent variable, the alternative hypothesis can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[ H_1: \\beta_1 \\neq 0 ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the coefficient $( \\beta_1 )$ is not equal to zero, indicating that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "During hypothesis testing in linear regression, we typically perform a t-test or F-test to assess the statistical significance of the coefficients. The p-value associated with these tests indicates the probability of observing the estimated coefficient (or more extreme values) if the null hypothesis were true. If the p-value is less than a predefined significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, concluding that there is a significant relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the null hypothesis represents the absence of a relationship, while the alternative hypothesis suggests the presence of a relationship between the independent and dependent variables in the linear regression model.\n",
