    "The Z-distribution, also known as the standard normal distribution, is a probability distribution that is often used in statistical analysis. It is a continuous distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The Z-distribution is useful in hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and determining probabilities associated with specific values or ranges of values."
