    "## Mutually Exclusive Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutually exclusive events are those where the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of the other. In the addition rule, this translates to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Condition:**\n",
    "  - If events A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability of their intersection $((P(A \\cap B)))$ is zero.\n",

    "    intersection $(P(A \\cap B))$ is greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition Rule for Not Mutually Exclusive Events:**\n",
    "  - The addition rule is adjusted to avoid double-counting the overlapping part: $ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutual Exclusivity:**\n",
    "  - Events A and B are mutually exclusive if $(P(A \\cap B) = 0)$.\n",

    "  - Events A and B are not mutually exclusive if $(P(A \\cap B) > 0)$.\n",
